Problem 2
In the energy image, the edges are bright because that's where they change colors.  Only the edges are bright, area within the edge are dark.  The cumulative minimum energy image is dark on the left and getting brighter as it goes to the right becuase it was a horizontal seam.  The values are calculated from left to right and adding the next values to the previous total.  So the values get bigger as you move to the right.  Bigger values are brighter colors.

Problem 3
These are the optimal seams because they have the lowest energy. They have the least content.

Problem 4
This image worked so well because it doesn't have a lot of content area. Most areas on the image are low energy. Not a lot of edges.

Problem 5
This imgage worked poorly because it has a lot of content area. It has a lot high energy areas and has a lot of edges. A lot of straight edges.
